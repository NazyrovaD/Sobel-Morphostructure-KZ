**Automated morphostructural analysis using Sobel operator and DEM data for East Kazakhstan**

This repository contains the Google Earth Engine (GEE) scripts and auxiliary materials used for automated detection of morphostructural lineaments based on the Sobel gradient operator.

---

## 🔍 Description
The workflow implements the Sobel operator for regional morphostructural zoning using DEMs (MERIT, SRTM, and ALOS).  
It includes:
- Gradient computation (Sobel, Laplacian, and Canny filters)  
- Thresholding of top 15% gradient values  
- Orientation and azimuthal analysis  
- Enrichment analysis relative to ore deposits  
- Visualization and export steps
